# 100 Days of Code — Frontend Foundations to Production

This repository documents my **100 Days of Code challenge**, where I’m deliberately rebuilding my frontend skills **from first principles to production-level applications**.

The focus is not speed or trends — it’s **competence, clarity, and correctness**.

Each day covers a specific concept, exercise, or small build, progressing from semantic HTML and accessibility to advanced React, Next.js, Firebase, testing, performance, and deployment.

## Why this challenge exists

After building several UI-focused projects, I realized I had blind spots in areas that actually matter long-term:
- Semantic HTML
- Accessibility as a default
- Layout fundamentals
- Understanding *why* things work, not just *how*

This challenge is a reset — not a restart.

The goal is to:
- Build strong foundations
- Eliminate knowledge gaps
- Practice consistently
- Document the learning process publicly

---

## Challenge structure (high level)

The 100 days are grouped into focused phases:

- **Weeks 1–2:** Semantic HTML, accessibility, responsive layouts, CSS fundamentals  
- **Weeks 3–5:** UI components, DOM manipulation, JavaScript patterns, async logic  
- **Weeks 6–8:** React fundamentals, advanced patterns, Tailwind CSS, design systems  
- **Weeks 9–10:** Next.js, Firebase (auth, database, storage, hosting)  
- **Weeks 11–12:** Testing, performance, accessibility audits, SEO  
- **Weeks 13–14:** Animations, portfolio polish, interview prep  
- **Days 99–100:** Capstone full-stack project and documentation  

Each day has:
- A clear objective
- A small, focused implementation
- Lessons learned

## Progress

### ✅ Day 3
**Semantic HTML landing page skeleton**

- Proper use of HTML5 landmarks (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `footer`)
- Logical heading hierarchy
- Accessibility considerations (ARIA labels, structure-first thinking)
- No frameworks or abstractions — just HTML and CSS

More days will be added incrementally as the challenge progresses.

---

## Tech stack (as it evolves)

Early days:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

Later stages:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js
- Firebase
- Testing tools (Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright/Cypress)

---

## How to use this repo

- Browse folders by **day**
- Read the code and comments
- Follow the progression from fundamentals to advanced concepts
- Use it as a reference or learning companion

This repo is intentionally incremental — not every folder is a “complete project.”

---

## Notes

This is a **learning-first repository**.
Code may be refactored as understanding improves.

The aim is not perfection on Day 1 —  
the aim is **measurable improvement by Day 100**.
